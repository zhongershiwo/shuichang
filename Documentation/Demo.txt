Module "Delay_us"  (component TimerInt_LDD)
   - Delay_us_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - Delay_us_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask).
   - Delay_us_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling.
